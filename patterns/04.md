# Decorators

Decorators (_supported by Babel_)

If you’re using something like mobx, you can decorate your class components — which is the same as
passing the component into a function. Decorators are flexible and readable way of modifying
component functionality.

Non-decorators approach

```javascript
class ProfileContainer extends Component {
  // Component code
}
export default observer(ProfileContainer);
```

With decorators

```javascript
@observer
export default class ProfileContainer extends Component {
  // Component code
}
```
